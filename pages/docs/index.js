          <span className="text-primary text-medium">Hit-List</span> is an online commands manager that allows you to take your command lists (i.e Hit
          Lists) with you anywhere and use them anytime. Hit-List CLI tool is built to help you reduce time spent repeating commands in the terminal;
          consequently improving your workflow efficiency.
          <b className="block mt-2">New: HitList can now save and sync your hits locally from the cloud.</b>
        </p>

            Scenario 1 : You have 5 commands to start up your server/program every day, that really does break the DRY (Don&apos;t Repeat Yourself)
            rule. With <span className="text-primary text-medium">Hit-List</span>, you can run these commands with just one HIT on any computer.

          <Text fontSize="xs">
            Scenario 2 : You are a very cautious coder and you commit your work very often, but again you have to run 3/4 git commands; tsk, very
            inefficient. This is already baked into <span className="text-primary text-medium">Hit-List</span> and you can easily run it with just ONE
            hit.
